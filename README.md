# Infinite scroll using Algolia and Vanilla JS

I've always been interested in looking into Algoila as a search engine for my projects but while learning I didn't feel like installing a bunch of packages and use out of the box solutions. 

Therefore I made this small example project where I implemented an infinite scroll UI for Algolia search results. Hopefully this will prove useful to more people!

## Features
- No packages to install
- Almost bare minimum styling
- Inline documentation
